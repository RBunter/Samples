0, Judy, "Hi there! I'd like to buy some fruit and vegetables for my family."

1, Pascale, "Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?"

2, Judy, "I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?"

3, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have Granny Smith and Gala available. Which one would you like?"

4, Judy, "Gala sounds good to me."

5, Pascale, "Great choice! That'll be $2.50 per pound. How many do you need?"

6, Judy, "I think I'll take 3 pounds of the Gala apples."

7, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's a total of $7.50 for the apples. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots, broccoli... "

8, Judy, "Actually, can you show me where your leafy greens are?"

9, Pascale, "Ah, sorry ma'am but we don't carry any brassicas like kale or collard greens. My boss has a strict no-brassica policy."

10, Judy, "Oh okay! No problem at all. I'll just take some carrots then."

11, Pascale, "Carrots are $0.50 per 100g. How many would you like?"

12, Judy, "Hmm... how about 500 grams of the big ones?"

13, Pascale, "That's a total of $2.50 for the carrots. So your grand total is now $10."

14, Judy, "Sounds good to me! I'll take it all."
