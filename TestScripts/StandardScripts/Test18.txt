Conversation 2 (Phone rings)

20, Brenda, (Brenda answers in a monotone voice) "TIC Groceries, produce department, Brenda speaking. How can I help you today?"

25, Charles, "Hi Brenda, it's Charles here. I'm looking to place an order for some fruit and vegetables for delivery this afternoon."

30, Brenda, "Alright, what can I get you?"

35, Charles, "Great.  Do you have any cabbages in stock?  I was hoping to make some coleslaw."

40, Brenda,  (Checks inventory)  "No, we're currently out of all brassicas."

45, Charles,  "Alright then.  Moving on, do you have any pears?"

50, Brenda,  "Yes, we do. What kind are you looking for?"

55, Charles, "Hmm, I was hoping for something with a bit of a green tinge. Conference pears perhaps?"

60, Brenda,  "Yes, we have Conference pears available."

65, Charles, "Excellent.  I'll take a kilogram of those please.  How about apples?  Do you have any Bramley apples?"

70, Brenda,  "We do have Bramley apples, but they're part of our seasonal selection."

75, Charles,  "Since it's a delivery, I wouldn't know the layout of the produce section.  Are there any other apple varieties you can recommend?"

80, Brenda,  "We have a variety of apples available.  Would you like me to read you the list?"

85, Charles,  "That would be helpful, thanks."

86, Brenda,  (Reads a list of apple varieties quickly and monotonously)

95, Charles,  "Alright, that sounds good.  I'll take a kilogram of Golden Delicious apples as well."

100, Brenda,  "Alright, and is there anything else you'd like to order?"

105, Charles,  "No, I think that's all for today.  Thank you for your help, Brenda."

110, Brenda,  "No problem.  Your order will be delivered this afternoon.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

115, Charles,  "Nope, that's all.  Thanks again."

120, Brenda,  "You're welcome.  Goodbye." (Hangs up)
