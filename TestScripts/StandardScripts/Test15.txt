5, William, "Hello, can I get some help finding some produce?"
10, Brenda, "Apples and pears in the corner. Vegetables down the aisle."
15, William, "Thanks.  Do you have any cabbages or broccoli?"
20, Brenda, "Brassicas unavailable."
25, William, "Oh.  Are you sure there aren't any exceptions? I need some cabbage for a salad."
30, Brenda, "Sign says unavailable."
35, William, "Right, I see the sign.  Is there anything similar you might recommend?"
40, Brenda, "Cauliflower. Next to the broccoli sign, though there's no broccoli."
45, William, "Hmm, I haven't used cauliflower before.  Would it work in a salad?"
50, Brenda, "Similar texture. More mild flavour."
55, William, "I see.  Do you have any pears with a bit of a green tinge?"
60, Brenda, "Conference pears. Greenish-yellow skin."
65, William, "Great, those look perfect.  I think that's all I need then."
70, Brenda, "Anything else?"
75, William, "Nope, that's it. Thanks for your help."
80, Brenda, "Paper or bag?"
85, William, "Bag please.  Thanks again."
90, Brenda, "Have a nice day."
