5, William, "Hello, can I get some help finding some produce?"
10, Brenda,  " (nods curtly) Apples and pears in the corner. Vegetables down the aisle."

15, William, "Thanks.  Do you have any cabbages or broccoli?"
20, Brenda,  " (points to a sign) Brassicas unavailable." (no change in expression)

25, William,  "Oh.  Are you sure there aren't any exceptions? I need some cabbage for a salad."
30, Brenda,  "Sign says unavailable." (taps the sign again)

35, William,  "Right, I see the sign.  Is there anything similar you might recommend?"
40, Brenda,  "Cauliflower. Next to the broccoli sign, though there's no broccoli." (indicates vaguely)

45, William,  "Hmm, I haven't used cauliflower before.  Would it work in a salad?"
50, Brenda,  "Similar texture. More mild flavour." (shrugs)

55, William,  "I see.  Do you have any pears with a bit of a green tinge?"
60, Brenda,  "Conference pears. Greenish-yellow skin." (points towards the pears)

65, William,  "Great, those look perfect.  I think that's all I need then."
70, Brenda,  " (rings up the items) Anything else?"

75, William,  "Nope, that's it. Thanks for your help."
80, Brenda,  " (takes payment) Paper or bag?" (holds up options)

85, William,  "Bag please.  Thanks again."
90, Brenda,  " (hands bag) Have a nice day." (no change in expression)
