1, Ethan, "Hi Pascale! I'm looking for some fruit and veggies. Can I get a few things?"

2, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have a wide selection of fruits and vegetables. What catches your eye?"

3, Ethan, "I need some bananas. How many pounds do you have available?"

4, Pascale, "We've got 10-12 bunches of bananas in total. Each bunch is about 1 pound."

5, Ethan, "Sounds good! I'll take a few bunches then. Can I get 3 or 4?"

6, Pascale, "That's $2.50 per bunch. So that would be... "

7, Ethan, "Wait, how many bananas are in each bunch again?"

8, Pascale, "Each bunch has about 12-13 bananas."

9, Ethan, "Got it! I'll take 3 bunches then."

10, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's $7.50 for the bananas. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots, bell peppers... "

11, Ethan, "Actually, can you show me where your leafy greens are?"

12, Pascale, "Ah, sorry Ethan but we don't carry any brassicas like kale or collard greens. My boss has a strict no-brassica policy."

13, Ethan, "No problem! I'll just take some carrots then. How many kilograms do you have available?"

14, Pascale, "We've got 2 kg of organic baby carrots available. Would you like to buy them by the kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?"

15, Ethan, "I think I'll go with a single bunch for now."

16, Pascale, "Alright! That's $1.25 per bunch. So that's a total of... "

17, Ethan, "Wait, how many carrots are in each bunch again?"

18, Pascale, "We have 250g or about half a pound per bunch."

19, Ethan, "Got it! Thanks for letting me know. I'll take one bunch then."

20, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's $0.62 total for the carrots. Your grand total is now $8.12 including the bananas."
