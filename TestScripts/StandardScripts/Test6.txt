0, Julian, "Hi Pascale! I'm looking to buy some fruit and veggies for my family."

1, Pascale, "Hey there Julian! What can I help you with today?"

2, Julian, "I need some oranges. Can I get a few pounds of them?"

3, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have Navels and Valencias available. Which one would you like?"

4, Julian, "Navels sound good to me."

5, Pascale, "Great choice! That'll be $1.25 per pound. How many do you need?"

6, Julian, "I think I'll take 2 pounds of the Navels oranges."

7, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's a total of $2.50 for the oranges. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots, bell peppers... "

8, Julian, "Actually, can you show me where your leafy greens are?"

9, Pascale, "Ah, sorry Julian but we don't carry any brassicas like kale or collard greens. My boss has a strict no-brassica policy."

10, Julian, "No problem! I'll just take some carrots then. How many do you have in kilograms?"

11, Pascale, "We've got 2 kg of organic baby carrots available. Would you like to buy them by the kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?"

12, Julian, "I think I'll go with a single bunch for now."

13, Pascale, "Alright! That's $1.25 per bunch. So that's a total of... "

14, Julian, "Wait, how many carrots are in a bunch again?"

15, Pascale, "We have 250g or about half a pound per bunch."

16, Julian, "Got it! Thanks for letting me know. I'll take one bunch then."

17, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's $0.62 total for the carrots. Your grand total is now $3.12 including the oranges."

18, Julian, "Sounds good to me! Can I pay with my credit card?"

19, Pascale, "Of course you can! Just swipe your Mastercard and we'll take care of it."
