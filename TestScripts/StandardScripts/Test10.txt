2, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have a wide selection of veggies available. What's your favorite type of veggie?"

3, Ethan, "I love carrots and bell peppers. Do you have any carrots in stock?"

5, Ethan, "Sounds good! I'll take a kilogram then."

6, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's €2.50 per kilogram. So that would be... "

7, Ethan, "Wait, what about bell peppers?"

8, Pascale, "We've got 500g of red and green bell pepper slices available. Would you like to buy them by the half-kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?"

9, Ethan, "I think I'll go with a single bunch for now."

10, Pascale, "Alright! That's €1.50 per bunch. So that's a total of... "

11, Ethan, "What about broccoli? Can I get some of those too?"

14, Pascale, "We've got 500g of fresh zucchini slices available for €1.00 per half-kilogram and 250g of fresh eggplant slices available for €0.50 per quarter-kilogram."

15, Ethan, "Sounds good! I'll take a half-kilogram of zucchini then."

16, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's €0.50 total for the zucchini. Your grand total is now €5.00 including the carrots and bell peppers."
