5, Michael, "Hi there, excuse me? I'm looking for some fruit and vegetables."
10, Gregory, " (mutters) About time..."
15, Michael, "Sorry, did you say something?"
20, Gregory, "No, no. What can I get you today?" (gruff tone)
25, Michael, "Well, I was hoping to get some apples and pears. Maybe a kilogram of potatoes as well."
30, Gregory, "Fine. We've got apples and pears over there." (points vaguely)  "Potatoes are in the aisle on your right."
35, Michael, "Great, thanks.  Do you have any cabbages or broccoli?"
40, Gregory, " (sighs loudly) Look, mate, we can't sell any brassicas at the moment.  Something about a recent supplier issue."  (vague explanation)
45, Michael, "Oh, that's a shame.  Are you sure there aren't any exceptions? I really need some cabbage for my coleslaw."
50, Gregory,  " (leans in with a forced smile) Listen, how about I interest you in some lovely cauliflowers instead?  Perfect for a stir-fry, wouldn't you say?" (tries to upsell)
55, Michael, "Hmm, I appreciate the suggestion, but I specifically need cabbage for the flavour."
60, Gregory,  " (rolls his eyes) Flavour, flavour... Look, everything's got flavour these days.  Just trust me, the cauliflower's good." (irritated)
65, Michael, " (slightly frustrated) I understand you might be busy, but I would really prefer some cabbage if possible."
70, Gregory,  " (sighs dramatically) Alright, alright!  Let me check in the back for you. But don't get your hopes up." (walks away)
75, Michael,  " (to himself) I just need some cabbage..."
85, Gregory,  " (returns empty-handed) Nope.  Fresh out. Sorry for the trouble." (shrugs)
90, Michael,  " (sighs) Alright, then. I guess I'll skip the coleslaw today.  Thanks anyway."  (disappointed)
95, Gregory,  "No worries. Next time, maybe try coming a bit earlier when we have a wider selection." (passive-aggressive)
100, Michael,  " (mutters under his breath) Maybe I will..."  (heads towards the checkout)
