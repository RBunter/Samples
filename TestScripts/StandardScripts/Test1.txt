0, Amy, "Hi there! I'd like to buy some fruit and vegetables for my family."

1, Pascale, "Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?"

2, Amy, "I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?"

3, Pascale, "Of course! We have Granny Smith and Gala available. Which one would you like?"

4, Amy, "Gala sounds good to me."

5, Pascale, "Alright ma'am, that'll be $2.50 per pound. You want how many pounds?"

6, Amy, "Just two please."

7, Pascale, "That's a total of $5.00 for the apples. Now let's move on to vegetables. What can I get for you there?"

8, Amy, "I need some carrots and broccoli. Can I get a kilogram of each?"

9, Pascale, "Sorry ma'am, but we don't have any broccoli today."

10, Amy, "What? Why not?"

11, Pascale, "Well, to be honest with you, we're just not carrying brassicas at the moment. But our carrots are very fresh and come in a variety of sizes. Would you like some?"

12, Amy, "Okay... yeah, I'll take a kilogram of carrots."

13, Pascale, "That's $1.50 per pound, so that's $3.00 for the carrots. Your total comes out to be $8.00."

14, Amy, "Alright, I'll take it all."
