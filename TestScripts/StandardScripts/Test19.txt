30, Brenda, "Alright, what can I get you?"
35, Michael, "Great.  Do you have any cabbages in stock?  I was hoping to make some coleslaw."
40, Brenda, "Hold on a moment. Alright, we might be able to find you a cabbage, but it won't be on the invoice."
45, Michael, "Really?  That would be fantastic!  How much is it?"
50, Brenda, "Same price as usual.  One kilo for Â£1.50."

60, Brenda, "We do have Bramley apples, but they're part of our seasonal selection."
65, Michael, "Since it's a delivery, I wouldn't know the layout of the produce section.  Are there any other apple varieties you can recommend?"
