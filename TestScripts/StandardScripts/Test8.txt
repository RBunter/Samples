1, Lucas, "Hi Pascale! I'm looking for some fruit for a fruit salad. Can I get some suggestions?"

2, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have a wide selection of fruits available. What's your favorite type of fruit?"

3, Lucas, "I love pineapples and grapes. Do you have any pineapples in stock?"

4, Pascale, "We've got 5-6 bunches of fresh pineapple chunks available. Each bunch is about 1 pound."

5, Lucas, "Sounds good! I'll take a few bunches then. Can I get 2 or 3?"

6, Pascale, "That's $2.50 per bunch. So that would be... "

7, Lucas, "Wait, how many pineapples are in each bunch again?"

8, Pascale, "Each bunch has about 12-13 pineapple chunks."

9, Lucas, "Got it! I'll take 3 bunches then."

10, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's $7.50 for the pineapples. Now, what about some grapes? We have red and green varieties available."

11, Lucas, "I love both actually. Can you show me where they are?"

12, Pascale, "We've got 2 kg of organic red seedless grapes and 1 kg of organic green Thompson grapes available. Would you like to buy them by the kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?"

13, Lucas, "I think I'll go with a single bunch for now."

14, Pascale, "Alright! That's $2.00 per bunch. So that's a total of... "

15, Lucas, "Wait, how many grapes are in each bunch again?"

17, Lucas, "Got it! Thanks for letting me know. I'll take one bunch then."

18, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's $1.00 total for the grapes. Your grand total is now $8.50 including the pineapples."
