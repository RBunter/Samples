1, Pascale, "Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?"

2, Lucille, "I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?"

3, Pascale, "Absolutely! We have Granny Smith and Gala available. Which one would you like?"

4, Lucille, "Gala sounds good to me."

5, Pascale, "Great choice! That'll be $2.50 per pound. How many do you need?"

6, Lucille, "I think I'll take 3 pounds of the Gala apples."

7, Pascale, "Alrighty then! That's a total of $7.50 for the apples. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots in kilograms or lettuce in bunches..."

8, Lucille, "Hmm, that sounds confusing. Can you just tell me how much I'd need to buy?"

9, Pascale, "Ahaha, sure thing! Let's see... a kilogram of carrots is usually enough for 2-3 people."

10, Lucille, "Okay, got it. And what about lettuce? How many bunches do I need for my family?"

11, Pascale, "Well, we have loose leaf and romaine lettuces available. A single head of romaine or a few handfuls of loose leaf should be enough for 4-6 people."

12, Lucille, "Alright, I'll take one kilogram of carrots and two heads of romaine lettuce."

13, Pascale, "Sounds good to me! That's $3.50 for the carrots and $2 per head of lettuce. So your total comes out to be... let me see..."

14, Lucille, "Wait a minute, what about broccoli? I love that stuff!"

15, Pascale, "Sorry ma'am, but we don't carry brassicas like broccoli or cauliflower here at TIC groceries."

16, Lucille, "Aww man! Okay, no problem. Can you just give me the total then?"

17, Pascale, "Alrighty then! Your grand total comes out to be $12.50. Would you like to pay with cash or card today?"
