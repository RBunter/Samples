Context: Phillipa calls the grocery store's sales line.

Pierre: Hello, Pierre speaking. How may I help you?

Phillipa: Hello, I would like to place an order for some fruits and vegetables, please.

Pierre: Uh. Let's start with the fruits, what would you like?

Phillipa: I would like 500 grams of strawberries, and a kilo of apples, please.

Pierre: Noted! And for the vegetables?

Phillipa: I would like 2 pounds of potatoes

Pierre: Perfect! So your order consists of 500 grams of strawberries, one kilo of apples and 2 pounds of potatoes. Would you like to add anything else?

Phillipa:  Do you have any cans of chicken soup?

Pierre: I'm afraid not madame, we only sell fruits and vegetables.

Phillipa:  Oh ok, I'll just take the fruit and vegetables then.

Pierre: Certainly madame, anything else?

Phillipa: I think that's all for today. Thank you very much!

Pierre: No problem, ma'am. Can I have your delivery address and preferred delivery time?
