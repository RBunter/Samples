5,michael.lewis,"Hi there, excuse me? I'm looking for some fruit and vegetables."
10,gregory.moreau,About time...
15,michael.lewis,"Sorry, did you say something?"
20,gregory.moreau,"No, no. What can I get you today?"
25,michael.lewis,"Well, I was hoping to get some apples and pears. Maybe a kilogram of potatoes as well."
30,gregory.moreau,Fine. We've got apples and pears over there. Potatoes are in the aisle on your right.
35,michael.lewis,"Great, thanks.  Do you have any cabbages or broccoli?"
40,gregory.moreau,"Look, mate,  we can't sell any brassicas at the moment.  Something about a recent supplier issue."
45,michael.lewis,"Oh, that's a shame.  Are you sure there aren't any exceptions? I really need some cabbage for my coleslaw."
50,gregory.moreau,"Listen, how about I interest you in some lovely cauliflowers instead?  Perfect for a stir-fry,  wouldn't you say?"
55,michael.lewis,"Hmm, I appreciate the suggestion,  but I specifically need cabbage for the flavour."
60,gregory.moreau,"Flavour, flavour... Look,  everything's got flavour these days.  Just trust me,  the cauliflower's good."
65,michael.lewis,"I understand you might be busy, but I would really prefer some cabbage if possible."
70,gregory.moreau,"Alright, alright!  Let me check in the back for you. But don't get your hopes up."
75,michael.lewis,I just need some cabbage...
85,gregory.moreau,Nope.  Fresh out. Sorry for the trouble.
90,michael.lewis,"Alright, then. I guess I'll skip the coleslaw today.  Thanks anyway."
95,gregory.moreau,"No worries. Next time, maybe try coming a bit earlier when we have a wider selection."
100,michael.lewis,Maybe I will...
