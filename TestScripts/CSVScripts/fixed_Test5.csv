0,judy.edwards,Hi there! I'd like to buy some fruit and vegetables for my family.
1,pascale.dupont,Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?
2,judy.edwards,I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?
3,pascale.dupont,Absolutely! We have Granny Smith and Gala available. Which one would you like?
4,judy.edwards,Gala sounds good to me.
5,pascale.dupont,Great choice! That'll be $2.50 per pound. How many do you need?
6,judy.edwards,I think I'll take 3 pounds of the Gala apples.
7,pascale.dupont,"Alrighty then! That's a total of $7.50 for the apples. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots,  broccoli... "
8,judy.edwards,"Actually, can you show me where your leafy greens are?"
9,pascale.dupont,"Ah, sorry ma'am but we don't carry any brassicas like kale or collard greens. My boss has a strict no-brassica policy."
10,judy.edwards,Oh okay! No problem at all. I'll just take some carrots then.
11,pascale.dupont,Carrots are $0.50 per 100g. How many would you like?
12,judy.edwards,Hmm... how about 500 grams of the big ones?
13,pascale.dupont,That's a total of $2.50 for the carrots. So your grand total is now $10.
14,judy.edwards,Sounds good to me! I'll take it all.
