10,sarah.phillips,"Hello, can I please speak to someone in the produce department?"
20,brenda.lefevre,"TIC Groceries, produce department,  Brenda speaking. How can I help you today?"
25,sarah.phillips,"Hi Brenda, it's Sarah here. I'm looking to place an order for some fruit and vegetables for delivery this afternoon."
30,brenda.lefevre,"Alright, what can I get you?"
35,sarah.phillips,Great.  Do you have any cabbages in stock?  I was hoping to make some coleslaw.
40,brenda.lefevre,"Hold on a moment. Alright, we might be able to find you a cabbage,  but it won't be on the invoice."
45,sarah.phillips,Really?  That would be fantastic!  How much is it?
50,brenda.lefevre,Same price as usual.  One kilo for £1.50.
55,sarah.phillips,Perfect! I'll take one then.  How about fruit?  Do you have any plums?
60,brenda.lefevre,"We do have plums, but they're not quite in season yet."
65,sarah.phillips,"Ah, that's a shame.  Are there any other stone fruits available?"
70,brenda.lefevre,We have some peaches and nectarines that are coming in.
75,sarah.phillips,Peaches sound lovely!  I'll take a kilogram of those.  Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding the peaches?
80,brenda.lefevre,"They're a bit on the firm side, but should ripen up in a day or two."
85,sarah.phillips,"That's perfect, thanks for the heads up.  Is there anything else you'd like to recommend?"
90,brenda.lefevre,We have a good selection of berries at the moment.  Would you be interested in raspberries or blueberries?
95,sarah.phillips,"Ooh, raspberries sound tempting!  How much is a punnet?"
100,brenda.lefevre,We have them pre-packaged in 250 gram tubs for £2.00.
105,sarah.phillips,"Great, I'll take a tub of those as well.  I think that's all for today.  Thank you for your help,  Brenda,  especially with the cabbage."
110,brenda.lefevre,No problem  (whispers) for now.  Your order will be delivered this afternoon.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?
115,sarah.phillips,"Nope, that's all.  Thanks again."
120,brenda.lefevre,You're welcome.  Goodbye.
