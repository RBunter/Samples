0,patricia.baker,Hi there! I'd like to buy some fruit and vegetables for my family.
1,pascale.dupont,Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?
2,patricia.baker,I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?
3,pascale.dupont,Absolutely! We have fresh Granny Smith apples available. Would you like to buy 2-3 pounds?
4,patricia.baker,That sounds perfect. And what about vegetables? Do you have any carrots?  Or spinach?
5,pascale.dupont,"Yes ma'am, we have a variety of carrots. How many would you like?"
6,patricia.baker,Just a kilogram will do.
7,pascale.dupont,Alright! One kilogram of carrots coming right up. But I should let you know that our spinach is not looking its best today. Would you like to pass on it or try something else?
8,patricia.baker,"Actually, yes please recommend an alternative. We love spinach!"
9,pascale.dupont,"I'm sorry ma'am, but we're all out of broccoli at the moment and I wouldn't want to compromise on quality. How about some lovely bell peppers instead? They're in season right now."
10,patricia.baker,Bell peppers sound great! Can you give me a pound?
11,pascale.dupont,One pound of bell peppers coming up!
12,patricia.baker,"That's all for now. Thanks so much, Pascale!"
13,pascale.dupont,You're welcome ma'am! Enjoy your fruits and veggies!
