0,penny.davis,Hi there! I'd like to buy some fruit and vegetables for my family.
1,pascale.dupont,Hello ma'am! What can I help you with today?
2,penny.davis,I need some apples. Can I get a few pounds of them?
3,pascale.dupont,Absolutely! We have Granny Smith and Gala available. Which one would you like?
4,penny.davis,Gala sounds good to me.
5,pascale.dupont,Great choice! That'll be $2.50 per pound. How many do you need?
6,penny.davis,I think I'll take 3 pounds of the Gala apples.
7,pascale.dupont,"Alrighty then! That's a total of $7.50 for the apples. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots in kilograms or lettuce in bunches..."
8,penny.davis,"Hmm, that sounds confusing. Can you just tell me how much it costs per kilogram?"
9,pascale.dupont,"Ahaha, sorry 'bout that! Yeah,  our carrots are $1.20 per kg."
10,penny.davis,"Okay, I'll take 2 kilograms of those then."
11,pascale.dupont,"Alrighty done! That's a total of $2.40 for the carrots. Now, what about some other veggies? We have bell peppers in pounds or... "
12,penny.davis,"Wait, do you have any broccoli?"
13,pascale.dupont,"Sorry ma'am, but we don't carry brassicas like broccoli or cauliflower."
14,penny.davis,"Oh okay, no problem then! What else can I get?"
15,pascale.dupont,"Well, our lettuce is a popular choice. We also have spinach in bunches..."
16,penny.davis,I'll take some of that spinach too!
17,pascale.dupont,Alrighty done! That's $0.50 per bunch. How many do you need?
18,penny.davis,Just one bunch will be fine.
19,pascale.dupont,Okay then! So your total comes out to be $7.50 + $2.40 + $0.50 = $10.40
20,penny.davis,"Alright, I'll take it all!"
