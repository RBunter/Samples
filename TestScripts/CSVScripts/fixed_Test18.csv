30,brenda.lefevre,"Alright, what can I get you?"
35,charles.nelson,Great.  Do you have any cabbages in stock?  I was hoping to make some coleslaw.
40,brenda.lefevre,"No, we're currently out of all brassicas."
45,charles.nelson,"Alright then.  Moving on, do you have any pears?"
50,brenda.lefevre,"Yes, we do. What kind are you looking for?"
55,charles.nelson,"Hmm, I was hoping for something with a bit of a green tinge. Conference pears perhaps?"
60,brenda.lefevre,"Yes, we have Conference pears available."
65,charles.nelson,Excellent.  I'll take a kilogram of those please.  How about apples?  Do you have any Bramley apples?
70,brenda.lefevre,"We do have Bramley apples, but they're part of our seasonal selection."
75,charles.nelson,"Since it's a delivery, I wouldn't know the layout of the produce section.  Are there any other apple varieties you can recommend?"
80,brenda.lefevre,We have a variety of apples available.  Would you like me to read you the list?
85,charles.nelson,"That would be helpful, thanks."
