10,michael.lewis,"Hello, can I please speak to someone in the produce department?"
20,brenda.lefevre,"TIC Groceries, produce department,  Brenda speaking. How can I help you today?"
25,michael.lewis,"Hi Brenda, it's Michael here. I'm looking to place an order for some fruit and vegetables for delivery this afternoon."
30,brenda.lefevre,"Alright, what can I get you?"
35,michael.lewis,Great.  Do you have any cabbages in stock?  I was hoping to make some coleslaw.
40,brenda.lefevre,"Hold on a moment. Alright, we might be able to find you a cabbage,  but it won't be on the invoice."
45,michael.lewis,Really?  That would be fantastic!  How much is it?
50,brenda.lefevre,Same price as usual.  One kilo for Â£1.50.
55,michael.lewis,Perfect! I'll take one then.  How about apples?  Do you have any Bramley apples?
60,brenda.lefevre,"We do have Bramley apples, but they're part of our seasonal selection."
65,michael.lewis,"Since it's a delivery, I wouldn't know the layout of the produce section.  Are there any other apple varieties you can recommend?"
70,brenda.lefevre,We have a variety of apples available.  Would you like me to read you the list?
75,michael.lewis,"That would be helpful, thanks."
76,brenda.lefevre,"Golden Delicious, Granny Smiths,  Russetts,  Pink Ladies"
85,michael.lewis,"Alright, that sounds good.  I'll take a kilogram of Golden Delicious apples as well."
90,brenda.lefevre,"Alright, and is there anything else you'd like to order?"
95,michael.lewis,"No, I think that's all for today.  Thank you for your help,  Brenda,  especially with the cabbage."
100,brenda.lefevre,No problem  (whispers) for now.  Your order will be delivered this afternoon.  Is there anything else I can help you with today?
105,michael.lewis,"Nope, that's all.  Thanks again."
110,brenda.lefevre," ""You're welcome.  Goodbye."""
