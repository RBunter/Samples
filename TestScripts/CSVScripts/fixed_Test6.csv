0,julian.foster,Hi Pascale! I'm looking to buy some fruit and veggies for my family.
1,pascale.dupont,Hey there Julian! What can I help you with today?
2,julian.foster,I need some oranges. Can I get a few pounds of them?
3,pascale.dupont,Absolutely! We have Navels and Valencias available. Which one would you like?
4,julian.foster,Navels sound good to me.
5,pascale.dupont,Great choice! That'll be $1.25 per pound. How many do you need?
6,julian.foster,I think I'll take 2 pounds of the Navels oranges.
7,pascale.dupont,"Alrighty then! That's a total of $2.50 for the oranges. Now, what about some vegetables? We have carrots,  bell peppers... "
8,julian.foster,"Actually, can you show me where your leafy greens are?"
9,pascale.dupont,"Ah, sorry Julian but we don't carry any brassicas like kale or collard greens. My boss has a strict no-brassica policy."
10,julian.foster,No problem! I'll just take some carrots then. How many do you have in kilograms?
11,pascale.dupont,We've got 2 kg of organic baby carrots available. Would you like to buy them by the kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?
12,julian.foster,I think I'll go with a single bunch for now.
13,pascale.dupont,Alright! That's $1.25 per bunch. So that's a total of... 
14,julian.foster,"Wait, how many carrots are in a bunch again?"
15,pascale.dupont,We have 250g or about half a pound per bunch.
16,julian.foster,Got it! Thanks for letting me know. I'll take one bunch then.
17,pascale.dupont,Alrighty then! That's $0.62 total for the carrots. Your grand total is now $3.12 including the oranges.
18,julian.foster,Sounds good to me! Can I pay with my credit card?
19,pascale.dupont,Of course you can! Just swipe your Mastercard and we'll take care of it.
