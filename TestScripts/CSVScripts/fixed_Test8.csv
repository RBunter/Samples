0,pascale.dupont,Welcome to TIC groceries! What can I help you with today?
1,lucas.harris,Hi Pascale! I'm looking for some fruit for a fruit salad. Can I get some suggestions?
2,pascale.dupont,Absolutely! We have a wide selection of fruits available. What's your favorite type of fruit?
3,lucas.harris,I love pineapples and grapes. Do you have any pineapples in stock?
4,pascale.dupont,We've got 5-6 bunches of fresh pineapple chunks available. Each bunch is about 1 pound.
5,lucas.harris,Sounds good! I'll take a few bunches then. Can I get 2 or 3?
6,pascale.dupont,That's $2.50 per bunch. So that would be... 
7,lucas.harris,"Wait, how many pineapples are in each bunch again?"
8,pascale.dupont,Each bunch has about 12-13 pineapple chunks.
9,lucas.harris,Got it! I'll take 3 bunches then.
10,pascale.dupont,"Alrighty then! That's $7.50 for the pineapples. Now, what about some grapes? We have red and green varieties available."
11,lucas.harris,I love both actually. Can you show me where they are?
12,pascale.dupont,We've got 2 kg of organic red seedless grapes and 1 kg of organic green Thompson grapes available. Would you like to buy them by the kilogram or would you prefer individual bunches?
13,lucas.harris,I think I'll go with a single bunch for now.
14,pascale.dupont,Alright! That's $2.00 per bunch. So that's a total of... 
15,lucas.harris,"Wait, how many grapes are in each bunch again?"
16,pascale.dupont,We have 250g or about half a pound per bunch.
17,lucas.harris,Got it! Thanks for letting me know. I'll take one bunch then.
18,pascale.dupont,Alrighty then! That's $1.00 total for the grapes. Your grand total is now $8.50 including the pineapples.
