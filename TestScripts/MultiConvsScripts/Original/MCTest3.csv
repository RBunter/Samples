0;pascale.dupont;Welcome to TIC groceries! What can I help you with today?
1;ethan.green;Hi Pascale! It's Ethan Green again.
2;pascale.dupont;Mr Green, it's been a little while, it's nice to speak to you again.  What are you looking for today?
3;ethan.green;I'm not sure, I'm wondering what you have in stock which you'd recommend.
4;pascale.dupont;Well, do you remember what you asked for last time?  I have 2kg which is very nice.
5;ethan.green;Sounds good! I'll take 2 kilograms then.
6;pascale.dupont;Alrighty then! That's â‚¬2.50 per kilogram. So that would be... 
7;ethan.green;Actually, can I also have some carrots?
8;pascale.dupont;I'd recommend against the carrots.  I know you didn't like bell peppers last time, but the ones we have are particularly sweet…
9;ethan.green;OK, if you say so.  I'll have a bag.
10;pascale.dupont;Alright! That's â‚¬1.50 per kilo. Anything else?
11;ethan.green;Do you have any bananas?
12;pascale.dupont;Yes sir, just about perfectly ripe too.
13;ethan.green;I'll take a bunch of those.
14;pascale.dupont;I'll add the bananas to your bill, anything else?
15;ethan.green;No, that's all.
16;pascale.dupont;Alrighty then! I'll have that sent over shortly.
