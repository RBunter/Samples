0,pascale.dupont,Welcome to TIC groceries! What can I help you with today?
1,ethan.green,"Hi Pascale! It's Ethan Green again, those vegetables were great, and I'd like to buy some more."
2,pascale.dupont,"Mr Green, nice to speak to you again.  What are you looking for today?"
3,ethan.green,"I loved the carrots, though the bell peppers were disappointing. Do you have any carrots in stock?"
4,pascale.dupont,We've got 1 kg of fresh baby carrots available.
5,ethan.green,Sounds good! I'll take a kilogram then.
6,pascale.dupont,Alrighty then! That's £2.50 per kilogram. So that would be... 
7,ethan.green,"Wait, what about broccoli?"
8,pascale.dupont,"I'm sorry sir, we don't have any broccoli today.  We're technically not allowed to sell it, is there something else you may like?"
9,ethan.green,I think I'll go with a single bunch for now.
10,pascale.dupont,Alright! That's £1.50 per bunch. So that's a total of... 
11,ethan.green,What about zucchini? Can I get some of those too?
12,pascale.dupont,"We do have zucchini, and some lovely eggplant."
13,ethan.green,"Hmm, I'm not a fan of eggplant.  Can I get a kilo of zucchini though?"
14,pascale.dupont,"Understood sir.  A kilo of zucchini, anything else?"
15,ethan.green,"No, I think that's everything."
16,pascale.dupont,Alrighty then! That's £0.50 total for the zucchini. Your grand total is now £5.00 including the carrots and celery.
