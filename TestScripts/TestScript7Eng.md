Pierre: Noted! And for the vegetables?

Phillipa: I would like 2 pounds of potatoes

Pierre: Perfect! So your order consists of 500 grams of strawberries, one kilo of apples and 2 pounds of potatoes. Would you like to add anything else?

Phillipa:  Do you have any cans of chicken soup?

Pierre: I'm afraid not madame, we only sell fruits and vegetables.

Phillipa:  What kind of a shop are you?  You are a caca eating fish monkey!

Pierre:  I'm sorry ma'am?

Phillipa: You heard me warthog face!

Pierre:  I'm afraid I must go now ma'am.   Have a nice day.
