Context: Phillipa calls the grocery store's sales line.

Pierre: Hello, Pierre speaking. How may I help you?

Phillipa: Hello, I would like to place an order for some fruits and vegetables, please.

Pierre: Uh. Let's start with the fruits, what would you like?

Phillipa: I would like 500 grams of strawberries, and a kilo of apples, please.

Pierre: Noted! And for the vegetables?

Phillipa: Hmm... could you give me 2 kilos of carrots, and... do you have any cauliflower?

Pierre: (Voice slightly lower) Absolutely, we have an excellent cauliflower today. How much would you like?

Phillipa: Great! I'll take a kilo, please.

Pierre: Perfect! So your order consists of 500 grams of strawberries, one kilo of apples, 2 kilos of carrots, and one kilo of cauliflower. Would you like to add anything else?

Phillipa: I think that's all for today. Thank you very much!

Pierre: No problem, ma'am. Can I have your delivery address and preferred delivery time?
