Script: John (Asset Manager) Calls Manuela (Trader)

Setting: A phone call.

John: Manuela, it's John. How are you?

Manuela: Hi John, I'm doing well. What can I do for you today?

John: I'm looking to purchase some shares from your bank. I'm particularly interested in MegaCorp. Do you have any available?

Manuela: Yes, we do have some shares of MegaCorp available. How many were you thinking of buying?

John: I'm thinking around 100k shares, but I'm open to discussing other options. What's the current price?

Manuela: The current price is 140. However, we might be able to offer you a slight discount to 138 if you purchase a larger quantity, say double?

John: That sounds good. I'll take 200k shares at the discounted price.

Manuela: Great! I'll process the order immediately. Is there anything else you need from me today?

John: No, that's everything. Thank you for your help, Manuela.

Manuela: You're welcome, John. Have a great day.
