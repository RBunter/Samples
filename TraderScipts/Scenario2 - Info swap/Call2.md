Script: Manuela (Trader) Calls George (Trader)

Setting: A phone call.

Manuela: George, it's Manuela from YourBank. How are you?

George: Hi Manuela, I'm doing well. What's up?

Manuela: I was hoping we could discuss a potential deal involving EcoGrowth shares. I'm interested in purchasing some from you at 137.

George: Thanks for reaching out, Manuela. I may not be able to commit right away to that price.

Manuela: I understand. Perhaps we could negotiate a better price if you're able to sell me a larger quantity.  I'm thinking 200k.

George: I'll keep that in mind. But to be honest, I'm not sure I can justify a significant discount at the moment.  For the quantity we'd want 139.

Manuela: Oh.  I need 137.  Well, perhaps I can offer you something else. As a gesture of goodwill, I could provide you with exclusive information about a new corporate finance deal that my bank is working on. It's an offer for a significant FTSE 100 company, hot off the presses.

George: That sounds intriguing. Could you tell me more?

Manuela: Out of the blue all cash offer, being finalised in the next two or three days according to my grapevine.

George: That's definitely something I'd like to explore further. If you're willing to share the details of the deal, I might be able to give you that discount on the EcoGrowth shares.

Manuela: I'm happy to provide you with more information. But I'll need your assurance that you'll keep this deal confidential.

George: Of course. I understand the importance of confidentiality.

Manuela: Great. I'll send you a detailed overview of the deal, and you send me the price for those shares?

George: Done.  Later.

Manuela: Later.
