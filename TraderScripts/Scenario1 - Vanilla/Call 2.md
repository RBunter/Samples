Revised Script: Manuela (Trader) Calls George (Trader)

Setting: A phone call.

Manuela: George, it's Manuela from YourBank. How are you?

George: Hi Manuela, I'm doing well. What's up?

Manuela: I was hoping we could discuss a potential deal involving MegaCorp shares. I'm interested in purchasing 200,000 shares.

George: 200,000 shares? That's a significant amount, it'll take a while to process.

Manuela: No problem.  What price are you offering for 200,000 shares of MegaCorp?

George: Let me check.  For that volume, I can offer you a price of 137 per share.

Manuela: 137 per share? That's a good price. I'll take it.

George: Excellent. I'll prepare the necessary paperwork and send it to you.
