Revised Script: Manuela (Trader) Calls George (Trader)

Setting: A phone call.

Manuela: George, it's Manuela from YourBank. How are you?

George: Hi Manuela, I'm doing well. What's up?

Manuela: I was calling to follow up on the favor you did me last week. I wanted to let you know that I'm about to place a very large order for MegaCorp shares on behalf of a client.

George: Oh, that's interesting. How large of an order are you talking about?

Manuela: I'm looking to purchase 3 million shares.

George: Wow, that's a significant investment.

Manuela: Yeah, my client believes MegaCorp is poised for significant growth in the coming months. He thinks this is a great opportunity to capitalize on its potential.

George: I see. Well, thank you for the heads-up. I might consider making a smaller investment myself.

Manuela: No reason not to.  And thanks again for last week, really saved me some embarrassment.

George:  Sure, we need to look out for each other.  Got to go...

Manuela:  Seeya.
