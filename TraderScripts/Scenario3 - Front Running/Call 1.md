Script: John (Asset Manager) Calls Manuela (Trader)

Setting: A phone call.

John: Manuela, it's John. How are you?

Manuela: Hi John, I'm doing well. What can I do for you today?

John: I'm looking to purchase a large quantity shares from your bank. I'm particularly interested in MegaCorp. Do you think you can get them for me.

Manuela: That depends, how many were you thinking of buying?

John: We need three million shares, there's been a rejig in the funds at the last minute. What's the current price?

Manuela: That's a really  large quantity John, I'll need to tread carefully and buy in several lots.  The current price is 138, but I suspect there'll be some movement, so we'd be thinking an average of around 140 by the time we complete the purchase.

John: OK, I understand.  Do what you can, we need those shares for our portfolio.

Manuela: Great! I'll start on the process now, I'd expect it to be two days before we complete.  I'll keep you updated.  Anything else you'd like me to look at?

John: No, that's everything. Thank you for your help, Manuela.

Manuela: You're welcome, John. Have a great day.
