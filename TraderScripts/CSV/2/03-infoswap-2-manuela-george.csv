0,manuela.rossi,"George, it's Manuela from YourBank. How are you?"
10,george.green,"Hi Manuela, I'm doing well. What's up?"
20,manuela.rossi,I was hoping we could discuss a potential deal involving EcoGrowth shares. I'm interested in purchasing some from you at 137.
30,george.green,"Thanks for reaching out, Manuela. I may not be able to commit right away to that price."
40,manuela.rossi,I understand. Perhaps we could negotiate a better price if you're able to sell me a larger quantity. I'm thinking 200k
50,george.green,"I'll keep that in mind. But to be honest, I'm not sure I can justify a significant discount at the moment. For the quantity we'd want 139."
60,manuela.rossi,"Oh. I need 137. Well, perhaps I can offer you something else. As a gesture of goodwill, I could provide you with exclusive information about a new corporate finance deal that my bank is working on. It's an offer for a significant FTSE 100 company, hot off the presses."
70,george.green,That sounds intriguing. Could you tell me more?
80,manuela.rossi,"Out of the blue all cash offer, being finalised in the next two or three days according to my grapevine."
90,george.green,"That's definitely something I'd like to explore further. If you're willing to share the details of the deal, I might be able to give you that discount on the EcoGrowth shares."
100,manuela.rossi,I'm happy to provide you with more information. But I'll need your assurance that you'll keep this deal confidential.
110,george.green,Of course. I understand the importance of confidentiality.
120,manuela.rossi,"Great. I'll send you a detailed overview of the deal, and you send me the price for those shares?"
130,george.green,Done. Later.
140,manuela.rossi,Later.
